# SunGAN
| Master in AI @ UPC | TFM. This project utilizes a Generative Adversarial Network in order to generate images from the Sun surface.

**Abstract**

*This works presents an alternative solution to the already existing physical
simulations for the Sun’s photosphere which are used to output a single texture image from the Sun’s surface. This simulations are slow and require huge
computational power, a cheaper alternative in time and resources is introduced.*

*Architectures for a Generative Adversarial Network and a Variational Autoeconder are considered and trained in the generation of small image tiles
(128x128px) that resemble the surface of the Sun around an area of approximately 2.62 ∗ 107km2 which with the proposed method can be composed into an
image of arbitrarily any size given enough tiles. [...]*
